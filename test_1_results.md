# Test 1 Results

Class average was an 84%.

You can see your written grade, out of 25. The multiple choice grade, also out of 25, is your final grade minus your written divided by three.

Example: Final grade grade of an 88 and a written of 22 has a difference of 66. Divided by 3 gives 22 / 25 on the multiple choice. 

Mid-term grades are due soon. I have to complete them for Freshman and first-year transfer students, which covers most of you. Reminder: Your grade can not be more than 10 points higher than your test/quiz grade. From the sylabus:
* **Grade Rules: *Your final numerical grade cannot be more than 10 points higher than your exam+quiz average.*** This is to ensure mastery of fundamental skills. For example, a student with a 60% exam+quiz grade and a 100% lab+project+participation would receive a final numerical grade of 70%.]

Quizes are 5% of the final grade, and will boost your exam+quiz score a bit, but basically you can't do much better than 10 points higher than your exam average. 

If you did not do as well as you hoped on the test, and your final exam grade is better, that will be reflected in your grade. I haven't decided exactly how yet, I still need to talk to the other professors.

But, also note that the next text and the final exam will be harder than this test.

Please look at what answers you got wrong and try to figure out why on your own. If you need help, come to office hours, either mine or the TA office hours.
