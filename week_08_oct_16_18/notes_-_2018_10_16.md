## `while` loops vs. `for` loops

A student had a question regarding when to use a `while` loop versus a `for` loop. 
* A `while` loop includes a conditional statement and runs until the conditional statement is `False` (may never run).
* A `for` loop iterates through an iterable data type (does not run if empty). The ones we're using are: 
    * string
    * dictionary
    * list
    * range
