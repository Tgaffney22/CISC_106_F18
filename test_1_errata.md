# Test 1 Errata

* For question #29, a comment in the code block of the remove_duplicates() function is wrong:
    * As written: "Loop through items in a_list. If item not in *a_list* then append it to new_list"
    * Should be: "Loop through items in a_list. If item not in *new_list* then append it to new_list"
