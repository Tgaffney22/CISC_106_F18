# Notes for October 11, 2018

General Announcements:
* Emails for the TAs doing the lab grading is on the top of the Canvas Home page now, and mine is there too.
* Class attendance largely based on the iClickers has been recorded. For the first five classes, through Sep. 11, everyone was marked present since I hadn't run an iClicker yet. I used the sheets I had you sign if you forgot your clicker, if there's an error and you were here for a class send me an email.
* An excused class will be represented in Canvas as a dash ('-') and an unexcused as a zero (0). Any "grade" in Canvas that is a dash is not counted when calculating your final grade. So excused absesnses neither help nor hurt you.
* Lowest two class participation grades are dropped, so having two or fewer zeros is the same as having none.
* I'm gong to start recording iClicker attendance immedately after class.
* Today's Agenda:
    * Project 1 reference guide
    * Mutable data types
    * Solve Tuesday's workbook
    * Assign today's workbook
