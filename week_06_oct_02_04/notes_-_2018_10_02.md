# Notes for October 2, 2018

General Announcements:
* One of the TA's has extended their office hours on Monday nights, they are now 5:00 PM to 8:00 PM
* One of the Quiz 3 questions tells you to round your answer to two decimal places. Make sure you call round() on both arguments to assertEqual().
 * ```assertEqual(round(3.1415, 2), round(3.141, 2))```
* The quiz has you import the math library. Refer to [the notebook on import statements from week three](https://github.com/enactdev/CISC_106_F18/blob/master/week_03_sept_11_13/import_statement_-_2018_09_11.ipynb) if you need a reference.
* Test review today
 * Reminder: 75% of grade is multiple choice with a scantron. 25% is hand written.
 * Multiple choice questions are very similar to iClicker questions I have presented in class, including the 15 you will do today.
 * Written questions follow the fomat of the [test questions](https://github.com/enactdev/CISC_106_F18/blob/master/practice_test_1_written.ipynb) I shared last week.

## Function arguments vs parameters
* Parameters are part of the function definition. They are what you include in the function's Docstring comments
* Arguments are what is passed to a function when you call it. Often, the argument will be a variable you have already assigned

**Example:**
```
# Here, 'an_int' is a parameter to the function 'mult_by_two'
def mult_by_two(an_int):
    return an_int * 2

# Here, the variable 'my_int' is instantiated, and then passed as an agument to the function
my_int = 5
print('Value returned by function:', mult_by_two(my_int))
```
