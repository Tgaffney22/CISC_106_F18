    "### You will not be tested on these definitions, but you will need to know them to understand this class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**argument**: (fix) A value passed to a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**branch**: One of the possible paths during the **flow of execution**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**bug**: An error in a program that either throws an error or results in code that does unexpected things.\n",
    "\n",
    "**body**: See **code block**\n",
    "\n",
    "**boolean expression**: An **expression** that **evaluates** to either ```True``` or ```False```. These are used by ```if``` statements and ```while``` loops. \n",
    "\n",
    "**chained conditional** A conditional **branch** with more than two possible flows of execution. In Python these are written with ```if``` , ```elif``` , and ```else```. Here, the ```if``` and each ```elif``` is a different 'link' in the chain. Within a **chained conditional**, only a single **code block** will be run. Once a conditional **evaluates** to True, its block is run and all the other ``elif`` conditionals are skipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "**code block**: (fix) Code that is grouped together. For example, the block of code that is run when an ```if``` statement **evaluates** to ```True```. In Python, this code will also be indented the same amount. \n",
    "\n",
    "**comment**: Written explanations of how the code works. A single-line comment starts with a '#' while multi-line comments are wrapped in tripe-quotations. (\"\"\" Pretend that is comment is spread over multiple lines. \"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**comparison operator**: An **operator** that compares two values and **evaluates** to ```True``` or ```False```. They are: ==, !=, >, <, >=, and <=.\n",
    "\n",
    "**conditional statement** (fix) -- Edit infinite loop?\n",
    "\n",
    "**data type**: The type of data a **variable** holds. For instance: integers, floats, strings, boolean, and lists. The data type determinites what you can do with the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "**debugging**: Finding and fixing program errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Docstring**: A formatted **comment** at the beginning of a function that explains what the function does.\n",
    "\n",
    "**edge case**: When a slight change in value causes a big change in expected outcome. For example, if a 18-year-old has to pay a higher price for admission than a child who is 17 or younger. When reading requirements for a program, keep in mind how different values will change the program's **flow of execution**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**evaluate**: Run a the code step-by-step. This can include multiple steps in a single line. For instance, within a single line of code, the inner-most parenthesis are evaluated first. Example: ```3 * (2 + 8)``` becomes ```3 * 10``` after the ```(2 + 8)``` is evaluated. In the next step, ```3 * 10``` is evaluated to ```30```\n",
    "\n",
    "**exception**: An error in your code\n",
    "\n",
    "**expression**: A line of code consisting of **operators** and values that **evaluate** to a single value. For example, when the expression: ```my_int = (2 * 5) + 3``` is finished evaluating, the variable ```my_int``` contines the value ```13```\n",
    "\n",
    "**flow of execution**: The order that lines in a program are run. **Statements** such as ```if``` and ```while``` change the **flow of execution** based on how many times they run. For example, if you have ```if```-```else``` statements that test to see if a user is old enough to vote, the **flow of execution** will take a different **branch** if the user is 17 versus if they are 18. \n",
    "\n",
    "**function**: (fix)\n",
    "\n",
    "**generalize**: To replace code that does something specific with code that handles more cases. For example: When we rewrote our ```is_even()``` function that took a single integer and returned a boolean ```True``` if the integer was even with the function ```is_evenly_divisible()``` that took two argument and returned a boolean ```True``` if the first number was evenly divisible by the second number. \n",
    "\n",
    "**infinite loop**: A badly-formed ```while``` loop where the conditional statement never **evaluates** to ```False```. \n",
    "\n",
    "**initialization**: Create a variable with an intitial value. Example: ```an_int = 5``` initialzes the variable ```an_int``` and assigns it the value ```5```. Or ```user_input = input('Enter your age')``` intializes the variable ```user_input``` with whatever the user types into their keyboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "**iteration**: Cycling through a **code block** multiple times. \n",
    "\n",
    "**logical operator**: An **operator** specific to a **boolean** **expression**. They are: ```and```, ```or```, and ```not```.\n",
    "\n",
    "**method**: A function that is attached to a specific object. For example, the string method ```upper()``` capitilizes the string. The code ```print('a'.upper())``` will print an uppercase \"A.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**nesting**: When a **code block** is included inside another **code block**. For example, when an ```if``` statement  has another ```if``` statement within it. \n",
    "\n",
    "**operator**: Special symbols used in expresions, such as the multiply symbol ```*```, the addition symbol ```+``` or the greater than symbol ```>```, the word ```and```. \n",
    "\n",
    "**parameter**: A variable name declared in the function definition to access an argument passed to the function. A function cna have zero, one, or multiple parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**program**: Written computer code, such as in Python, that performs a series of instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**return value** The value returned by a function with the ```return``` **statement**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**rules of precedence**: The rules that govern the order that **operators** are **evaluated**. For instance, multiplcation such as ```3 * 2``` is **evaluated** before addition such as ```2 + 1```. Thus, the expression ```2 + 3 * 2``` evaluates to ```8```. A good resource is this [Operator precedence table](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/CS152f17/Appendices/PrecedenceTable.html) from \"How To Think Like a Computer Scientist\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**runtime error**: The program works initially, but certain input or changes in values cause it to crash and throw an error. Example, accidently dividing by zero. \n",
    "\n",
    "**semantic error**: The program continues to run (does not crash), but the results are unexpected.\n",
    "\n",
    "**state**: (Needs a better explanation.) All the values of every variable in the system at a moment in time. Debugging often involves stepping through a program line-by-line and updating how each line changes the state of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "**statement**: An instruction run by Python. For instance, the ```if``` statement or a ```while``` loop. (```while``` is a statement that is run in a loop until it **evaluates** to ```False```)\n",
    "\n",
    "**variable**: A name defined by a programmer that referes to a value of a specific **data type**. For example: ```my_int = 5``` assigns the variable ```my_int``` the integer ```5```. \n",
